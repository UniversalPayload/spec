Chapter 4: Payload Handoff Format
=================================

Here we define the handoff information from Platform Init to Payload, which
takes the form of an devicetree blob. This section describes the bindings used
for each area addressed by this specification.

A devicetree is a tree data structure with nodes that describe the devices in a
system. Each node has exactly one parent except for the root node, which has no
parent. Each node has property/value pairs that describe the characteristics of
the device being presented. Properties consist of a name and a value. Property
names are strings of 1 to 31 characters. Property values are an array of zero or
more bytes that contain information associated with the property.

The sections below show which nodes should be passed from Platform Init and its
corresponding property / value. It does not change what is passed from the
Payload to the OS, but it is intended to avoid interfering with it, i.e. it uses
the same bindings where possible.

A pointer to the FIT is provided so that the running image can find other images
it needs and find out where they were loaded.

Note that properties indicated as 'u32 / u64' have a size determined by the
architecture, either 32 or 64 bits.

.. note::

4.1 Standard Properties and Property Values
---------------------------------------------

4.1.1 Property Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A property value is an array of zero or more bytes that contain information
associated with the property.

Properties might have an empty value if conveying true-false information. In
this case, the presence or absence of the property is sufficiently descriptive.

Here are list of standard value types defined by the DTSpec [DTspec]_:

.. tabularcolumns:: | p{4cm} p{12cm} |
.. _property-values-table:
.. table:: Property values
   :class: longtable

   ======================== ==================================================================
   Value                    Description
   ======================== ==================================================================
   ``<empty>``              Value is empty. Used for conveying true-false information, when
                            the presence or absence of the property itself is sufficiently
                            descriptive.
   ``<u32>``                A 32-bit integer in big-endian format. Example: the 32-bit value
                            0x11223344 would be represented in memory as:

                               ::

                                  address    11
                                  address+1  22
                                  address+2  33
                                  address+3  44
   ``<u64>``                Represents a 64-bit integer in big-endian format. Consists of
                            two ``<u32>`` values where the first value contains the most
                            significant bits of the integer and the second value contains
                            the least significant bits.

                            Example: the 64-bit value 0x1122334455667788 would be
                            represented as two cells as: ``<0x11223344 0x55667788>``.

                            The value would be represented in memory as:

                               ::

                                    address  11
                                  address+1  22
                                  address+2  33
                                  address+3  44
                                  address+4  55
                                  address+5  66
                                  address+6  77
                                  address+7  88
   ``<string>``             Strings are printable and null-terminated. Example: the string
                            "hello" would be represented in memory as:

                               ::

                                    address  68  'h'
                                  address+1  65  'e'
                                  address+2  6c  'l'
                                  address+3  6c  'l'
                                  address+4  6f  'o'
                                  address+5  00  '\0'
   ``<prop-encoded-array>`` Format is specific to the property. See the property definition.
   ``<phandle>``            A ``<u32>`` value. A *phandle* value is a way to reference another
                            node in the devicetree. Any node that can be referenced defines
                            a phandle property with a unique ``<u32>`` value. That number
                            is used for the value of properties with a phandle value
                            type.
   ``<stringlist>``         A list of ``<string>`` values concatenated together.

                            Example: The string list "hello","world" would be represented in
                            memory as:

                               ::

                                      address  68  'h'
                                    address+1  65  'e'
                                    address+2  6c  'l'
                                    address+3  6c  'l'
                                    address+4  6f  'o'
                                    address+5  00  '\0'
                                    address+6  77  'w'
                                    address+7  6f  'o'

4.1.2 Standard Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[DTspec]_ defines a list of standard properties that is commonly used across
many DT nodes. Due to its enormous amount of details, please refer to [DTspec]_
Chapter 2.3 (Standard Properties) directly for the full details of each standard
properties.

Here is a list of example standard properties:

* compatible
* model
* phandle
* status
* #address-cells and #size-cells
* reg
* virtual-reg
* ranges
* dma-ranges

Here are the standard properties that are used for this spec:

.. _sp_acsc:

4.1.2.1 #address-cells and #size-cells
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Property name: ``#address-cells``, ``#size-cells``

Value type: ``<u32>``

Description:

   The *#address-cells* and *#size-cells* properties may be used in any
   device node that has children in the devicetree hierarchy and describes
   how child device nodes should be addressed. The *#address-cells*
   property defines the number of ``<u32>`` cells used to encode the address
   field in a child node's *reg* property. The *#size-cells* property
   defines the number of ``<u32>`` cells used to encode the size field in a
   child node’s *reg* property.

   Here are some important notes:

   * The *#address-cells* and *#size-cells* properties are not inherited from 
     ancestors in the devicetree. They shall be explicitly defined.

   * A spec-compliant boot program shall supply *#address-cells* and
     *#size-cells* on all nodes that have children.

   * If missing, it should be assumed that a default value of 2 for
     *#address-cells*, and a value of 1 for *#size-cells*.

Example:

   See the following devicetree excerpt:

   .. code-block:: dts

      soc {
         #address-cells = <1>;
         #size-cells = <1>;

         serial@4600 {
            compatible = "ns16550";
            reg = <0x4600 0x100>;
            clock-frequency = <0>;
            interrupts = <0xA 0x8>;
            interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
         };
      };

   In this example, the *#address-cells* and *#size-cells* properties of the
   ``soc`` node are both set to 1. This setting specifies that one cell is
   required to represent an address and one cell is required to represent the
   size of nodes that are children of this node.

   The serial device *reg* property necessarily follows this specification
   set in the parent (``soc``) node—the address is represented by a single cell
   (0x4600), and the size is represented by a single cell (0x100).


.. _sp_reg:

4.1.2.2 reg
""""""""""""""

Property name: ``reg``

Property value: ``<prop-encoded-array>`` encoded as an arbitrary number of
(*address*, *length*) pairs.

Description:

   The *reg* property describes the address of the device’s resources
   within the address space defined by its parent bus. Most commonly this
   means the offsets and lengths of memory-mapped IO register blocks, but
   may have a different meaning on some bus types. Addresses in the address
   space defined by the root node are CPU real addresses.

   The value is a *<prop-encoded-array>*, composed of an arbitrary number
   of pairs of address and length, *<address length>*. The number of
   *<u32>* cells required to specify the address and length are
   bus-specific and are specified by the *#address-cells* and *#size-cells*
   properties in the parent of the device node. If the parent node
   specifies a value of 0 for *#size-cells*, the length field in the value
   of *reg* shall be omitted.

Example:

   Suppose a device within a system-on-a-chip has two blocks of registers, a
   32-byte block at offset 0x3000 in the SOC and a 256-byte block at offset
   0xfe00. The *reg* property would be encoded as follows (assuming
   *#address-cells* and *#size-cells* values of 1):

      ``reg = <0x3000 0x20 0xfe00 0x100>;``


.. _sp_ranges:

4.1.2.3 ranges
""""""""""""""""

Property name: ``ranges``

Value type: ``<empty>`` or ``<prop-encoded-array>`` encoded as an arbitrary
number of (*child-bus-address*, *parent-bus-address*, *length*) triplets.

Description:

   The *ranges* property provides a means of defining a mapping or
   translation between the address space of the bus (the child address
   space) and the address space of the bus node’s parent (the parent
   address space).

   The format of the value of the *ranges* property is an arbitrary number
   of triplets of (*child-bus-address*, *parent-bus-address*, *length*)

   * The *child-bus-address* is a physical address within the child bus'
     address space. The number of cells to represent the address is bus
     dependent and can be determined from the *#address-cells* of this node
     (the node in which the *ranges* property appears).
   * The *parent-bus-address* is a physical address within the parent bus'
     address space. The number of cells to represent the parent address is
     bus dependent and can be determined from the *#address-cells* property
     of the node that defines the parent’s address space.
   * The *length* specifies the size of the range in the child’s address space. 
     The number of cells to represent the size can be determined from the
     *#size-cells* of this node (the node in which the *ranges* property
     appears).

   If the property is defined with an ``<empty>`` value, it specifies that the
   parent and child address space is identical, and no address translation
   is required.

   If the property is not present in a bus node, it is assumed that no
   mapping exists between children of the node and the parent address
   space.

Address Translation Example:

   .. code-block:: dts

       soc {
          compatible = "simple-bus";
          #address-cells = <1>;
          #size-cells = <1>;
          ranges = <0x0 0xe0000000 0x00100000>;

          serial@4600 {
             device_type = "serial";
             compatible = "ns16550";
             reg = <0x4600 0x100>;
             clock-frequency = <0>;
             interrupts = <0xa 0x8>;
             interrupt-parent = <&ipic>;
          };
       };

   The ``soc`` node specifies a *ranges* property of

      ``<0x0 0xe0000000 0x00100000>;``

   This property value specifies that for a 1024 KB range of address space,
   a child node addressed at physical 0x0 maps to a parent address of
   physical 0xe0000000. With this mapping, the ``serial`` device node can
   be addressed by a load or store at address 0xe0004600, an offset of
   0x4600 (specified in *reg*) plus the 0xe0000000 mapping specified in
   *ranges*.


.. _sp_dma-ranges:

4.1.2.4 dma-ranges
""""""""""""""""""""

Property name: `dma-ranges``

Value type: ``<empty>`` or ``<prop-encoded-array>`` encoded as an arbitrary
number of (*child-bus-address*, *parent-bus-address*, *length*) triplets.

Description:

   The *dma-ranges* property is used to describe the direct memory access (DMA)
   structure of a memory-mapped bus whose devicetree parent can be accessed from
   DMA operations originating from the bus. It provides a means of defining a
   mapping or translation between the physical address space of the bus and the
   physical address space of the parent of the bus.

   The format of the value of the *dma-ranges* property is an arbitrary number
   of triplets of (*child-bus-address*, *parent-bus-address*, *length*). Each
   triplet specified describes a contiguous DMA address range.

   * The *child-bus-address* is a physical address within the child bus'
     address space. The number of cells to represent the address is bus
     dependent and can be determined from the *#address-cells* of this node
     (the node in which the *dma-ranges* property appears).
   * The *parent-bus-address* is a physical address within the parent bus'
     address space. The number of cells to represent the parent address is
     bus dependent and can be determined from the *#address-cells* property
     of the node that defines the parent’s address space.
   * The *length* specifies the size of the range in the child’s address space. 
     The number of cells to represent the size can be determined from the
     *#size-cells* of this node (the node in which the *dma-ranges* property
     appears).



4.2 UPL Devicetree Nodes

Here is the list of devicetree nodes for UPL usage:

   compatible        R           string       "upl"
   boot-mode         O           string list  For supporting different Payload boot flows. These influence how the payload runs. Note that this is not intended to support multiple Payloads.
                                              This string list is not meant to be prescriptive and only serves as an example data handoff, as long as Payload is able to recognise the value. Furthermore,
                                              Payload is not required to support all of the boot modes. For boot modes those are not supported by Payload, Payload can just ignore them without any specific
                                              actions. This property could be further refined in the future revisions.

                                              * “normal” means booting with full functionality, from power off.
                                              * “fast” means fast boot with no configuration change or minimal functionality.
                                              * “full", "diag” means booting with full functionality plus diagnostics functions.
                                              * “default” means booting with “reset to default” flow (for example, boot from RTC battery power failure).
                                              * “s4” means resuming from ACPI S4 state (resume from disk).
                                              * “factory” means booting with manufacturing mode.
                                              * “s3” means resuming from ACPI S3 state (resume from memory).
   addr-width        O           u32          52 means host address width is 52 bits. 46 means address width is 46 bits.
                                              This is mainly used by Payloads when initializing page tables. This can avoid the payload needing to access the SoC directly to obtain this information.
   pci-enum-done     O           empty        When pci-enum-done present, payload will skip PCI resource assignment and it will use pci-rb node information to create internal resource map to ensure no conflict
                                              usage of those in-used PCI resources during payload execution.

                                              When pci-enum-done not present, payload may do the PCI enumeration to assign resources basing on pci-rb node information, and could also create resource map too.

                                              In some payloads, a simple PCI enumeration may still be executed even with “pci-enum-done” to collect PCI device information and bind corresponding drivers to
                                              provide services and functionality. 
                                              (for example, find out network controller and bind network driver to support network functionality)

4.2.3 Node: /options/upl-image@<addr> (R)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior of Platform Init when loading a FIT cannot always be known at build
time. For example:

* Platform Init may select one of several configurations when loading the
  Payload; the configuration chosen may depend on the hardware that it is
  running on
* Platform Init may load images to any address if there is no 'load' property in
  the image.

The Payload may need to know where one of the images ended up in memory, or
which configuration was chosen. It cannot find this out by itself. The
'image' node provides information to help with these problems.

4.2.4 Node: /options/upl-image/image@<addr> (O)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This node is only required if Platform Init loaded the images to different
addresses. In the case where the FIT is used in-place, this is not needed.

The name of this node must match the name of the corresponding image node in the
FIT. This provides information about the loaded images.

Each loaded image has a separate node created with the following properties:

4.2.5 Node: /pci (R)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Payload may need below FDT nodes for collecting PCI devices information on the
system for binding corresponding drivers to provide services and functionality.

There could be 2 or more root bridge nodes and even the same PCI segment may be
shared by several root bridges. In this case ecam-base-addr in the PCI root
bridge node is important for payload to know how to access each root bridge as
well as what segment they belong to. (by masking bus/dev/func, the same
ecam-base-addr will be the same segment root bridges).

Under each root bridge node, there could be several root ports and/or PCI
devices listed as its child nodes. Please refer the example use case below for
reference implementation.

The PCI bindings in this node must follow this specification - the IEEE Std
1275-1994 Standard for Boot (Initialization Configuration) Firmware
[PCIBusBinding]_ with some restrictions.

As the #address-cells is always 3, the child / PCI address has to be presented
in this format, **per PCI Bus Binding spec** [PCIBusBinding]_:

* The non-prefetchable and prefetchable memory windows must each be exactly
  256MB (0x10000000) in size.
* The prefetchable memory window must be immediately adjacent to the
  non-prefetcable memory window.

Here is a bitmap of the 3-cell address which is followed by the explanation of
each bit:

* Cell 1: npt000ss bbbbbbbb dddddfff rrrrrrrr
* Cell 2: hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh
* Cell 3: llllllll llllllll llllllll llllllll

Notes:

* n: 0 if the address is relocatable, 1 otherwise
* p: 1 if the addressable region is "prefetchable", 0 otherwise
* t: 1 if the address is aliased (for non-relocatable I/O), below 1 MB (for
  Memory), or below 64 KB (for relocatable I/O)
* ss: space code

  * 00: configuration space
  * 01: I/O space
  * 10: 32 bit memory space
  * 11: 64 bit memory space

* bbbbbbbb: The PCI bus number
* ddddd: The device number
* fff: The function number
* rrrrrrrr: Register number. Not used.

                                                      so it is the parent's cell count of address and size used.

                                                      node (3). The cells of CPU address is the value of #address-cells in the parent node. The cells of PCI size is the value of #size-cells in PCI
                                                      node (2).

                                                      The data is used to define IO, prefetchable/non-prefetchable MMIO resources that can be utilized for the root bridge which can be assigned to
                                                      downstream devices.

                                                      If the property is not present in a bus node, it is assumed that no mapping exists between children of the node and the parent address space.

4.2.6 Node: /isa (O)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different kinds of buses each using their own addressing scheme. Among
them are usually memory addresses, legacy I/O Ports and PCIe. In summary
one needs to surround the node using legacy I/O ports with a “isa” bus node.

For clarification, this node can be used for LPC and eSPI devices, as from
software pespective, both are ISA compatible.

   ================= =========== =================== ==============================================

Specific legacy I/O devices are descirbed in child nodes. For UPL usage, only
serial console is supported for now - further legacy I/O devices can be expended
later if required. Please refer to :ref:`serial_console` for serial console use
cases.

For its child node, 'reg' property is required, and it is in the format of:
<(enum) (address) (size)>; and here is the usage for the `enum`:
* 0x0   # memory address
* 0x1   # I/O address


.. _serial_console:

4.2.7 Node: Serial Console Device (SD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This refers to the debug / log console, where Payload can setup and use the same
UART controller as Platform Init for seamless debug output. There can be more
than one UART controller defined, and the '/chosen' node must include a
'stdout-path' property pointing to this device when it is used, as per
[DTspec]_.

This node is mandatory if a serial device is available and initialized by
Platform Init.

4.2.8 Node: framebuffer (for Display) (SD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally only one framebuffer is provided in the handoff. It should be the
'primary' one (if such a concept exists in the system) and visible to the user.
A 'display0' alias should provide the full path to the device. Where the device
itself is not represented in the devicetree, the 'display0' alias should point
to the simple-framebuffer node.

Look at the display0 alias. If this is a simple-framebuffer, then use that
If not, search for a node with the "simple-framebuffer" compatible string, which
has a 'display' property matching the display0 alias.

Note: If more than one framebuffer/ display device exist, the stdout-path in 
'chosen' node must point to the freamebuffer node preferred to be used by the
payload (in the case that only a single display output is supported by payload).

   ================= =========== ================== ======================================================================================================================================================================

Example below shows how framebuffer node is generated:

Example 1 (non-PCI):

.. code-block:: dts

   
   // Optional alias
   aliases {
      display0 = &framebuffer0;
   };

   framebuffer0: framebuffer@b0000000 {
      compatible = "simple-framebuffer";
      reg =<0x0 0xb0000000 0x040 0x500000>;
      width = <1280>;
      height = <1024>;
      format = "a8r8g8b8";
   };


Example 2: (PCI)

.. code-block:: dts

   
   // Optional alias
   aliases {
      display0 = &gma;
   };

   pcie@10000000 {
      compatible = "pci-host-ecam-generic";
      reg = <...>
      ranges = <...>;
      pcie@8 {
         /* Root port 00:01.0 */
         reg = <0x00000800 0 0 0 0>;
         ranges = <...>;
         gma: gma@2,0 {
            /* gfx device 01:00.0 */
            reg = <0x00010000 0 0 0 0>;
         };
      };
   };

   framebuffer@b0000000 {
      compatible = "simple-framebuffer";
      reg = <0xb0000000>; // or use the BAR to access the framebuffer
      // these likely come from EDID talking to the panel
      width = <3840>;
      height = <2160>;
      format = "a8r8g8b8";
      display = <&gma>;
   };



4.2.9 Node: chosen (R)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For details about chosen node, please refer to [DTspec]_ Chapter 3.6 for the
chosen node usage. For the UPL usecase, please refer to the example below:

.. note::

   In this case the stdout is printed to two serial ports and one graphical
   framebuffer simultaneously.

.. code-block:: dts

   
   chosen {
      bootargs = "root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=192.168.1.1 console=ttyS0,115200";
      stdout-path = "/soc/serial0", "/soc/serial1", "/soc/framebuffer1";
   };


4.2.10 Node: /options/upl-custom (O)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the firmware sometimes might require additional/ customized information to
be passed in due to some very specific use cases (for example, the vendor might
add specific data to be consumed by Payload for specific setup or driver use
cases like Intel CSME Features), hence custom nodes are allowed here for the
flexibility. If the node data becomes common or popular enough in the future,
we can create a separate node later for that node data.

4.2.11 Node: /memory (R)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The memory node is required to describe the physical-memory layout for the
system. If a system has multiple ranges of memory, multiple memory nodes can
be created, or the ranges can be specified in the reg property of a single
memory node. See the Devicetree Specification ("/memory node" section) for
details.

4.2.12 Node: reserved-memory (R)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the reserved memory description models, namely **simple descriptor (Memory
Reservation Block)** and **standard descriptor (reserved memory node)** are
supported to provide information about memory which is not available for use.
Payload shall exclude reserved memory from normal usage.

If Memory Reservation Block is used, payload is free to chose default attributes
it wants to assign to this block. What is guaranteed is that this memory will be
provided to OS as "reserved" memory. No memory optimisations (such as reclaim
etc.) will be possible. On the other hand, standard reserved memory node will
provide better control over memory range handling in firmware.

For further information on Memory Reservation Block, please refer to [DTspec]_
Chapter 5.3.

Here are the table description for standard reserved memory node. One can create
child nodes describing particular reserved (excluded from normal use) memory
regions. Such memory regions are usually designed for the special usage by
various device drivers.

Each child of the reserved-memory node specifies one or more regions of reserved
memory. Each child node may either use a 'reg' property to specify a specific
range of reserved memory, or a 'size' property with optional constraints to
request a dynamically allocated block of memory.

Following the generic-names recommended practice, node names should reflect the
purpose of the node (ie. "framebuffer" or "dma-pool"). Unit address (@<address>)
should be appended to the name if the node is a static allocation.

**Compatible string list for Child Node:**

This is used to describe memory type for UPL usage. One of the example usage is
that Payload will be aware of where pre-installed ACPI tables or NVS regions are
and will adopt them for supporting additional ACPI table installation from
payload phase. Those boot-code / boot-data regions from Platform Init will be
reported to OS as usable memory without waste. Similarly, runtime-code /
runtime-data may be provided by Platform Init for supporting firmware runtime
services that will be used by OS. All of the below are optional and can be
skipped if unsupported by the platform.


  ================== ======================================================
  Compatible string       Description
  ================== ======================================================
    acpi              Memory that holds ACPI tables
    acpi-nvs          ACPI NVS buffer information
    boot-code         Memory that holds firmware phase drivers and will be
                      released to the OS when firmware boot phase finishes
                      (for example with a UEFI payload when ExitBootService
                      signaled).
    boot-data         Memory that holds firmware phase data consumed by drivers
                      and will be released to the OS when firmware boot phase
                      finishes (for example with a UEFI payload when
                      ExitBootService signaled).
    runtime-code      Runtime service code memory region which will be used
                      by OS runtime services.
    runtime-data      Runtime service data memory region which will be used
                      by OS runtime services.
    special-purpose   Specific-purpose memory (e.g.: HBM or CXL). The memory
                      is earmarked for specific purposes such as for specific
                      device drivers or applications.
                      
                      This attribute serves as a hint to the OS to avoid
                      allocating this memory for core OS data or code that
                      can not be relocated. Prolonged use of this memory for
                      purposes other than the intended purpose may result in
                      suboptimal platform performance.
    smbios            If Platform Init has created a SMBIOS data buffer, this
                      will have the SMBIOS data buffer region information.
                      SMBIOS 3.0 or above must be supported by payload.
